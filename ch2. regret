Actually, if someone asks me what I did at university,
 I don’t have a confident answer.
I just played games and did the homework I was given.
I always set big goals, but that’s all. 
I don’t do anything to achieve them.

It’s not that I did nothing at all.
When achieving a goal required an effort level of ten, I always gave about seven.
I was always just a little short of reaching my goals—never doing nothing, 
 yet never doing enough—so I was left with a lingering sense of regret.
