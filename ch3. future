After taking the interview for the overseas training program, I finally found the answer to this problem.
I used to love staying at home and taking rest.
I thought resting was an investment for my future.
However, that belief turned out to be harmful rather than helpful.

While preparing for the overseas program, I often came home late, yet instead of feeling tired, I felt joy and refreshment.
Now, I no longer want to prepare for my future only inside my home.
I want to gain energy from the outside world and keep pushing myself forward.

In that sense, the overseas training program will be my first step toward breaking free from my comfort zone and moving beyond the glory of my past.
This is the true reason why I want to join the program, something I couldnâ€™t fully express during the interview.
